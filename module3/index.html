              The modern chicken is a descendant of red junglefowl hybrids along with
              the grey junglefowl first raised thousands of years ago in the northern
              parts of the Indian subcontinent.

              Chicken as a meat has been depicted in Babylonian carvings from around
              600 BC. Chicken was one of the most common meats available in the
              Middle Ages. It was eaten over most of the Eastern
              hemisphere and a number of different kinds of chicken such as capons,
              pullets and hens were eaten. It was one of the basic ingredients in the
              so-called white dish, a stew usually consisting of chicken and fried
              onions cooked in milk and seasoned with spices and sugar.  Chicken fry
            </p>
            <p>
              In the 1800s chicken was more expensive than other meats and it was
              "sought by the rich because [it is] so costly as to be an uncommon
              dish." Chicken consumption in the United States increased during World
              War II due to a shortage of beef and pork. In Europe, consumption
              of chicken overtook that of beef and veal in 1996, linked to consumer
              awareness of Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mad cow disease).
            </p>
            <p>
              Modern varieties of chicken such as the Cornish Cross, are bred
              specifically for meat production, with an emphasis placed on the ratio
              of feed to meat produced by the animal. The most common breeds of chicken
              consumed in the US are Cornish and White Rock.
            </p>
            <p>
              Chickens raised specifically for food are called broilers. In the United
              States, broilers are typically butchered at a young age. Modern Cornish
              Cross hybrids, for example, are butchered as early as 8 weeks for fryers
              and 12 weeks for roasting birds.
            </p>
            <p>
              Capons (castrated cocks) produce more and fattier meat. For this reason,
              they are considered a delicacy and were particularly popular in the
              Middle Ages.

            <p>
              Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle. Beef can be harvested
              from bulls, heifers or steers. Its acceptability as a food source varies
              in different parts of the world.
            </p>
            <p>
              Beef muscle meat can be cut into roasts, short ribs or steak (filet
              mignon, sirloin steak, rump steak, rib steak, rib eye steak, hanger
              steak, etc.) Some cuts are processed (corned beef or beef jerky), and
              trimmings, usually mixed with meat from older, leaner cattle, are ground,
              minced or used in sausages. The blood is used in some varieties of blood
              sausage. Other parts that are eaten include the oxtail, liver, tongue,
              tripe from the reticulum or rumen, glands (particularly the pancreas
              and thymus, referred to as sweetbread), the heart, the brain (although
              forbidden where there is a danger of bovine spongiform encephalopathy,
              BSE), the kidneys, and the tender testicles of the bull (known in
              the United States as calf fries, prairie oysters, or Rocky Mountain
              oysters). Some intestines are cooked and eaten as-is, but are more
              often cleaned and used as natural sausage casings. The bones are used
              for making beef stock.
            </p>
            <p>
              Beef from steers and heifers is very similar. According to the most
              recent National Beef Quality Audit, heifer carcasses had slightly
              more marbling than steer carcasses, but USDA quality grade was not
              significantly different. Depending on economics, the number of heifers
              kept for breeding varies. The meat from older bulls is usually tougher,
              so it is frequently used for mince (known as ground beef in the United
              States). Cattle raised for beef may be allowed to roam free on grasslands,
              or may be confined at some stage in pens as part of a large feeding
              operation called a feedlot (or concentrated animal feeding operation),
              where they are usually fed a ration of grain, protein, roughage and a
              vitamin/mineral preblend.
            </p>
            <p>
              Beef is the third most widely consumed meat in the world, accounting for
              about 25% of meat production worldwide, after pork and poultry at 38%
              and 30% respectively. In absolute numbers, the United States, Brazil,
              and the People's Republic of China are the world's three largest consumers
              of beef; however, Uruguay has the highest beef and veal consumption per
              capita, followed by Argentina and Brazil. According to the data from OECD,
              the average Uruguayan ate over 42 kg (93 lb) of beef or veal in 2014,
              representing the highest beef/veal consumption per capita in the world. In
              comparison, the average American consumed only about 24 kg (53 lb) beef
              or veal in the same year, while African countries, such as Mozambique,
              Ghana, and Nigeria, consumed the least beef or veal per capita.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2014, the world's largest exporters of beef were Brazil, Australia and
              the United States, respectively. Beef production is also important to
              the economies of Uruguay, Canada, Paraguay, Mexico, Argentina, Belarus
              and Nicaragua.

            <p>
              Sushi (すし, 寿司, 鮨) is a type of food preparation originating in
              Japan, consisting of cooked vinegared rice (鮨飯 sushi-meshi) combined
              with other ingredients (ネタ neta) such as raw seafood, vegetables and
              sometimes tropical fruits. Ingredients and forms of sushi presentation
              vary widely, but the ingredient which all sushi have in common is rice
              (also referred to as shari (しゃり) or sumeshi (酢飯)). Although
              commonly mistaken for sushi, sashimi, which is also a Japanese delicacy,
              consists of thinly sliced raw fish and may or may not be served with rice.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sushi can be prepared with either brown or white rice. It is often
              prepared with raw seafood, but some common varieties of sushi use cooked
              ingredients and many are vegetarian. Sushi is often served with pickled
              ginger, wasabi, and soy sauce. Popular garnishes are often made using
              daikon.
            </p>
            <p>
              The original type of sushi, known today as nare-zushi (馴れ寿司,
              熟寿司,) was first made in Southeast Asia. Fish was salted and wrapped
              in fermented rice, a traditional lacto-fermented rice dish. Narezushi was
              made of this gutted fish which was stored in fermented rice for months
              at a time for preservation. The fermentation of the rice prevented the
              fish from spoiling. The fermented rice was discarded and fish was the
              only part consumed. This early type of sushi became an important source
              of protein for the Japanese. The term sushi comes from an antiquated
              grammatical form no longer used in other contexts, and literally means
              "sour-tasting", a reflection of its historic origin as a fermented
              food. The oldest form of sushi in Japan, narezushi, is still made by
              wrapping fish in soured fermenting rice, which causes the fish proteins
              to break down into their constituent amino acids. The fermenting rice
              and fish have both a sour and an umami taste.
            </p>
            <p>
              Contemporary Japanese sushi has little resemblance to the traditional
              lacto-fermented rice dish. Originally, when the fermented fish was taken
              out of the rice, only the fish was consumed while the fermented rice
              was discarded. The strong-tasting and smelling funazushi, a kind
              of narezushi made near Lake Biwa in Japan, resembles the traditional
              fermented dish. Beginning in the Muromachi period (1336–1573) of Japan,
              vinegar was added to the mixture for better taste and preservation. The
              vinegar accentuated the rice's sourness and was known to increase
              its shelf life, allowing the fermentation process to be shortened and
              eventually abandoned. In the following centuries, sushi in Osaka evolved
              into oshi-zushi. The seafood and rice were pressed using wooden (usually
              bamboo) molds. By the mid 18th century, this form of sushi had reached
              Edo (contemporary Tokyo).
            </p>
            <p>
              The contemporary version, internationally known as "sushi", was created
              by Hanaya Yohei (1799–1858) at the end of the Edo period in Edo. Sushi
              invented by Hanaya was an early form of fast food that was not fermented
              (therefore prepared quickly) and could be conveniently eaten with one's
              hands. The size of the previous sushi was about three times as large as
              contemporary ones. Originally, this sushi was known as Edomae zushi
              because it used freshly caught fish in the Edo-mae (Edo Bay or Tokyo
              Bay). Though the fish used in modern sushi no longer usually comes from
              Tokyo Bay, it is still formally known as Edomae nigirizushi.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Oxford English Dictionary notes the earliest written mention
              of sushi in English in an 1893 book, A Japanese Interior, where it
              mentions sushi as "a roll of cold rice with fish, sea-weed, or some
              other flavoring". However, there is also mention of sushi in a
              Japanese-English dictionary from 1873, and an 1879 article on Japanese
              cookery in the journal Notes and Queries.
